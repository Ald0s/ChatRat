# ChatRat
A very basic, but colourful and informative TCP based chat application. The solution is to demonstrate the application of my networking library; ZapNetwork. As always, the code presented within is my own and if you intend to use anything for your own projects; I ask you include due credits, that is, a simple mention toward my github at the top of the source file.

### Getting Started
Simply compile the solution with Visual Studio (or your choice of compiler.)
Remember to also acquire [ZapNetwork](https://github.com/Ald0s/ZapNetwork) and add it as a reference!
