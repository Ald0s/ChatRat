    ChatRat - Project Overview
========================================================================

An application of the 'ZapNetwork' networking library I'm working on. This chat application will be a colourful, fun but very basic demonstration of the workings of TCP and how it can be applied to a chat application. The UI is all packaged neatly into the one frame, with the use of a properietary panel system that allows contextual options, embedded panels etc.

As always, the code presented within is my own and if you intend to use anything for your own projects; I ask you include due credits, that is, a simple mention toward my github at the top of the source file.
